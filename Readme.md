# Project Title: Advanced Video Hosting Backend

## Summary:

Welcome to our Advanced Video Hosting Backend initiative! This sophisticated backend infrastructure has been meticulously developed using cutting-edge technologies such as Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, Mongoose, JWT, Bcrypt, and others. Our objective with this endeavor is to furnish you with a sturdy framework for constructing a video hosting platform akin to YouTube. It encompasses indispensable features including user authentication, video uploading, engagement metrics (likes, dislikes, comments, replies), subscription management, and more. I've extensively worked on the backend, gaining practical insights into its operation at a production level. This journey has been immensely gratifying, providing me with comprehensive knowledge about backend intricacies

## Features:

- **User Authentication:** Utilizing industry-standard practices like JWT (JSON Web Tokens) and Bcrypt for secure user authentication.
  
- **Video Management:** Enable users to seamlessly upload, manage, and view videos within the platform.
  
- **Engagement Metrics:** Implement features such as likes, dislikes, comments, and replies to foster user engagement and interaction.
  
- **Subscription Management:** Allow users to subscribe to channels and manage their subscriptions effortlessly.

## Technologies Used:

- **Node.js:** A powerful JavaScript runtime environment for building scalable server-side applications. [Documentation](https://nodejs.org/)
  
- **Express.js:** A minimalist web application framework for Node.js that facilitates the development of robust APIs. [Documentation](https://expressjs.com/)
  
- **MongoDB:** A versatile NoSQL database for storing and managing application data. We recommend using MongoDB Atlas for cloud hosting. [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas/register)
  
- **Mongoose:** An elegant MongoDB object modeling tool for Node.js that provides a straightforward schema-based solution. [Documentation](https://mongoosejs.com/)
  
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens):** A standard for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. [Documentation](https://jwt.io/)
  
- **Bcrypt:** A popular encryption library used for hashing passwords to enhance security.

## MongoDB Atlas:

MongoDB Atlas is a fully managed cloud database service designed to automate the operational aspects of database management. It unifies operational and general AI data services to streamline building enterprise-ready AI-powered apps. MongoDB Atlas offers native vector storage and search capabilities, allowing you to go to market faster with minimal cost and complexity. It's free up to a certain threshold, typically around 400-500 MB of storage.
